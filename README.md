# America ACF Local JSON Manager

One of the great things about version 5 of the Advanced Custom Fields plugin is the ability to save forms as local JSON, which dramatically speeds up ACF and allows for version control over field settings.

However, it has a big drawback. You can only have one save location for all of your local JSON forms. This will cause problems if you have more than one plugin/theme that depends on ACF and utilizes local JSON to save your forms.

This plugin gives administrators the ability to choose where to save an ACF field group's local JSON.
